I'm a third-year **Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA)** student passionate about the intersection of **business strategy, marketing, and data-driven analysis**.

I view business challenges as complex puzzles. I enjoy diving into case studies, analyzing market dynamics, and understanding what makes a business successful. I use this GitHub profile as a portfolio to document my analytical projects, strategic reports, and marketing analyses.

My goal is to leverage data insights to help organizations grow, optimize operations, and achieve their strategic goals.
